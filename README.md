# QuantumComputingProject
Qubit Visualization Project using Python 

## Current implementation:
Just basic legacy bindings from Pyglet's OpenGL wrapper stuff
We also have a multi-threaded solution for handling input while rendering one vector representation of our qubit.

## What to do next:
- Object-orienting our qubit to be able to be easily duplicated/operated on seperately from other 

- Updating to more modern OpenGL solutions, I mostly stuck to legacy since technically it's far simpler without shaders

- Bettering our menu, a proper TUI would be awesome.
